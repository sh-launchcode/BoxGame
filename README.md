# BoxGame

With the most recent pygames and python version updates, this code cannot work. I have a readme.py file within this repository that explains what versions I used to create this game. 

The goal of this game is to cover as many boxes as possible once the pygame window pops up after you run the software. Arrow keys will maneuver the player box around with only using 100 key events. Good Luck!
